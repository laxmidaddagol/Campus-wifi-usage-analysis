This repository contains my work on analysing campus Wi-Fi usage patterns.  
It is inspired by and based on an open-source project available at [Original Project Name](https://github.com/OriginalAuthor/OriginalProject).  
I have customised the scripts, data and analysis to suit my own learning goals and added additional notebooks, visualisations and explanations.  
The purpose of publishing this here is to document my learning process in data analytics and to share my modifications with others who might find them useful
